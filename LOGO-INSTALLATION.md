## 🔄 After Adding Logo

Once you've uploaded the logo through Shopify:

   - Verify it's centered (or positioned as desired)

   - Go to **Theme settings > Favicon**
   - Upload a square version (64x64px or 32x32px)
   - This appears in browser tabs

3. **Test Transparency**

   - Check on different page types (home, product, collection)

## 💡 Pro Tips

**Logo Positioning:**
- **Center:** Best for minimalist, balanced look (recommended)
- **Left:** Traditional e-commerce layout
- **Right:** Unique, modern approach

**Logo Size Guidelines:**
- Too small: Hard to see, unprofessional
- Too large: Dominates header, pushes other elements
- **Sweet spot:** 150-200px on desktop

**Mobile Considerations:**
- Mobile logo should be 60-70% of desktop size
- Ensure it's readable at small sizes
- Test on actual mobile devices
